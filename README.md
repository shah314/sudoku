<i><h3>Shalin Shah</h3></i>
<P><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</A> is a Japanese puzzle 
in which a 9x9 grid is partially filled with numbers from 1 to 9. A solution to 
this puzzle fills in the empty cells of the grid such that there are no 
repeating numbers in each row, each column and each 3x3 subgrid.</P>

<H3>Backtracking Solver</H3>
<P>Backtracking Solver (depth-first, non-recursive) fills the grid starting from the cell that has the least possible valid values. For most instances, it reports all possible solutions to the input grid in a few milliseconds. 
<h3>Sudoku Puzzle Generator</h3>
<P>The puzzle generator generates random Sudoku puzzle instances. Generated puzzles have unique solutions. A blank sudoku grid is available <a href="http://www.saidwhat.co.uk/sudokus/sudokugrid.pdf">here.</a>
